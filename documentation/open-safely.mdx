OpenSAFELY gives trusted researchers restricted levels of access to the server to run analysis on real data and obtain aggregate results, without having sight of the patient level data. Aggregate results are checked to ensure there are no disclosure risks before being released from the server. This highly secure way of working enables researchers to have access to large and sensitive datasets in a safe manner.

This project had two main aims: 

- To understand the reach and coverage of the NHS @Home programme during the pandemic. Specifically looking at: blood pressure monitoring, pulse oximetry and proactive care interventions. 

- To understand how to approach an analysis project using OpenSAFELY, including the amount of time and resource required, and whether this platform would be useful for future analyses.
