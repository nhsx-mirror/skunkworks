# Data Lens

> Data Lens brings together information about multiple databases, providing a fast-access search in multiple languages

As the successful candidate from a Dragonsâ€™ Den-style project pitch, Data Lens was first picked as a pilot project for the NHS AI (Artificial Intelligence) Lab Skunkworks team in September 2020.

The pitch outlined a common data problem for analysts and researchers across the UK: large volumes of data held on numerous incompatible databases in different organisations. The team wanted to be able to quickly source relevant information with one search engine.

## Results

A prototype website implementing elasticsearch and natural language search across a number of NHS databases.
