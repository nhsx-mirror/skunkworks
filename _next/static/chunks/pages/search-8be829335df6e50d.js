For our general public-facing website, please visit the <a href='https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/ai-lab/ai-lab-programmes/skunkworks/'>AI Skunkworks programme</a>.</Alert>\n\nThe [AI Skunkworks programme](https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/ai-lab/ai-lab-programmes/skunkworks/) is part of the [NHS AI Lab](https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/ai-lab/). It finds new ways to use AI for driving forward the early adoption of technology to support health, in both clinical and business contexts. The team provides free short-term expertise and resources to public sector health and social care organisations to support AI projects and develop capability.\n\n## How we work\n\nThe NHS AI Lab Skunkworks team runs short-term projects to investigate the use of AI for improving efficiency and accuracy in health and care.\n\nThe Skunkworks' vision is that organisations in the health and care system will be able, through practical experience, to understand, build, buy, deploy, support, and challenge AI solutions.\n\nWe run projects in three ways:\n\n### 1. Internal\n\nUtilising our internal team of data scientists and data / technology leads, we are able to run small agile projects that may involve one-to-one coaching in the use of python and machine learning frameworks, through to data discoveries to help assess whether the data your organisation possesses is suitable for an AI approach.\n\n\n### 2. Short term resource\n\nWe are able to sponsor individual contractors provided through the [Public Sector Resourcing framework](https://www.publicsectorresourcing.co.uk/) to assist in the conception or implemention of AI solutions for your organisation.\n\n### 3. Supplier-led\n\nParterning with the Home Office's [Accelerated Capability Environment (ACE)](https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/accelerated-capability-environment-ace), we are able to sponsor 12 week agile projects using a pool of cutting edge AI suppliers.\n\nHealth and care organisations can submit their proposed AI problem, and we will work with ACE to select and manage a supplier to deliver an AI proof of concept.\n\nThese projects culminate with:\n\n* Working code, published under an Open Source license on Github\n* A technical report, detailing methodology and findings\n\n\n### Capability building\n\nWe are able to provide ad-hoc support, advice and education through initiatives such as our AI Deep Dive workshops.\n\n## Get in touch\n\nYou can reach us via email at [ai-skunkworks@nhsx.nhs.uk](mailto:ai-skunkworks@nhsx.nhs.uk)\n",title:"Overview",summary:"The NHS AI Lab Skunkworks team demonstrates the potential for AI in health and social care",category:"Overview"},{slug:"team",content:'\n# Team\n\n## Current members\n\n<TeamMember name="Giuseppe Sollazzo" role="Head of AI Skunkworks, Deputy Director NHS AI Lab" image="images/team-giuseppe.jpeg" imageAlt="Photograph of Giuseppe Sollazzo" bio={`\n   Giuseppe Sollazzo is Head of NHS AI Lab Skunkworks and Deployment at the NHS AI Lab at NHSX.
